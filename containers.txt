#What are Containers?
- Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated software environments that package applications with their dependencies for consistent execution across different platforms.
- They streamline development, deployment, and management while ensuring applications run reliably regardless of underlying infrastructure.

#Need for Containers
- Containers solve environment inconsistency issues when working in teams by standardizing runtime environments.
- Before containers, significant time was lost configuring local environments to run projects shared by teammates, leading to "works on my machine" problems.

#Bare Metal vs VM vs Containers
- Bare metal runs applications directly on hardware with maximum performance but limited flexibility.
- VMs use hypervisors to run multiple OS instances with strong isolation but higher overhead.
- Containers share the host OS kernel, providing lightweight isolation with better resource efficiency than VMs while maintaining portability.

#Docker and OCI
- The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a Linux Foundation project which aims at creating industry standards for container formats and runtimes.
- Its primary goal is to ensure the compatibility and interoperability of container environments through defined technical specifications.
